# Five-Awesome-Chinese-Restaurants-in-San-Francisco-CA
My 5th project for the Udacity FEND program. In this project I use Google Maps API, Yelps API, and knockout.js to create a web app that displays 5 Awesome Chinese Restaurants in San Francisco, CA. This is still a work in progress and is not complete yet.

## Installation
To install and run this web application, simply download the repository as a zipfile and extract.
After extracting the zipfile, open the index.html file in your web browser. You can click on the
marker icons on the map for the five locations loaded on default to view more information about them.
